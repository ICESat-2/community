# ICESat-2 / community
A place to share code for working with ICESat-2 data

## Introduction

This repository is inded to promote access to ICESat-2 data from NASA, by offering access to the latest community-driven code, and by bringing together tools developed by the scientific community for accessing, processing, and visualizing ICESat-2 data.  

## What this repository provides:

The main product of the ICESat-2 community repository is the document you are reading now.  In it, we will keep a list of links to NASA-funded repositories.  We would also like to host notebooks showing workflows for common ICESat-2 tasks.

## How you can contribute:

If you have a link or a notebook that you would like to see here, please fork the repository, add your material, and submit a pull request.

## ICESat-2 open-source projects

The ICESat-2 project has funded the development of several large-scale projects aimed at improving access to ICESat-2 data.

- [IcePyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx)

- [slideRule](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule)

-  [OpenAltimetry](https://github.com/OpenAltimetry)

## Hackweeks

A number of ICESat-2 resources have been created as part of the ICESat-2 hackweeks:

- [ICESat-2 hackweek](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek)

- [SnowEx hackweek](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/intro.html)

## PI-owned repositories

Projects within the ICESat-2 science team have also generated some great open-source content.  These may be at different levels of polish, but they almost certainly contain all the tools you might need to get up and running with ICESat-2 data.
