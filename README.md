# ICESat-2 / community
A place to share code for working with ICESat-2 data

## Introduction

This repository is inded to promote access to ICESat-2 data from NASA, by offering access to the latest community-driven code, and by bringing together tools developed by the scientific community for accessing, processing, and visualizing ICESat-2 data.  

## What this repository provides:

The main product of the ICESat-2 community repository is the document you are reading now.  In it, we will keep a list of links to NASA-funded repositories.  We would also like to host notebooks showing workflows for common ICESat-2 tasks.

## How you can contribute:

If you have a link or a notebook that you would like to see here, please fork the repository, add your material, and submit a pull request.

## ICESat-2 open-source projects

The ICESat-2 project has funded the development of several large-scale projects aimed at improving access to ICESat-2 data.

- [IcePyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx) : A community-driven effort to provide data-access tools for ICESat-2 data

- [slideRule](https://github.com/ICESat2-SlideRule) : A framework that allows high-performace data access and real-time generation of custom ICESat-2 products

-  [OpenAltimetry](https://github.com/OpenAltimetry) : A web-based browser for ICESat-2 data, that also allows access to underlying data structures

## Hackweeks

A number of ICESat-2 resources have been created as part of the ICESat-2 hackweeks:

- [ICESat-2 hackweek](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek)

- [SnowEx hackweek](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/intro.html)

## PI-maintained repositories

Projects within the ICESat-2 science team have also generated some great open-source content.  These may be at different levels of polish, but they almost certainly contain all the tools you might need to get up and running with ICESat-2 data.

- [PhoREAL](https://github.com/icesat-2UT/PhoREAL) : A collection of software for analysis of ICESat-2 land and vegetation data. <!---(Note: contains no real pho)-->

- [The Antarctic Rift Catalog Project](https://github.com/bradlipovsky/antarctic-rift-catalog) : A project to map rifts in ice shelves around Antarctica

- [CapToolkit](https://github.com/fspaolo/captoolkit) : A do-it-all library of code for working with cryospheric altimetry data

- [pointCollection](https://github.com/SmithB/pointCollection/) : A library of code for basic interactions with point data (including ICESat-2 tools)

## Data-product code repositories

Some of the higher-level products are generated using code that is available on github:

- [ATL11](https://github.com/suzanne64/ATL11) : Code to generate the ATL11 (Slope-Corrected Land Ice Height Time Series) product based on the ATL06 (Land-ice height) product.

- [ATL14/15](https://github.com/SmithB/ATL1415) : Code to generate the gridded ice-sheet DEM and height-change products from ATL11
